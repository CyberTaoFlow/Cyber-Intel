**APT's**

APT = Advanced Persistent Threat

How APTs work:

1. The cyber criminal, or threat actor, gains entry through an email, network, file, or application vulnerability and inserts malware into an organization's network. The network is considered compromised, but not breached.

2. The advanced malware probes for additional network access and vulnerabilities or communicates with command-and-control (CnC) servers to receive additional instructions and/or malicious code.

3. The malware typically establishes additional points of compromise to ensure that the cyber attack can continue if one point is closed.

4. Once a threat actor determines that they have established reliable network access, they gather target data, such as account names and passwords. Even though passwords are often encrypted, encryption can be cracked. Once that happens, the threat actor can identify and access data.

5. The malware collects data on a staging server, then exfiltrates the data off the network and under the full control of the threat actor. At this point, the network is considered breached.

6. Evidence of the APT attack is removed, but the network remains compromised. The cyber criminal can return at any time to continue the data breach.
